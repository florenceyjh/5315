      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>GIT is a virsual control system. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.</p>
      <p>Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.</p>
      <h2>What is local repo?</h2>
      <p>The local repository is a directory on the computer where Maven runs. It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. </p>
      <h2>What is remote repo?</h2>
      <p>Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository. These repositories might be a truly remote repository set up by a third party to provide their artifacts for downloading. Other "remote" repositories may be internal repositories set up on a file or HTTP server within your company, used to share private artifacts between development teams and for releases.</p>
      <h2>How to use GIT in Team Project?</h2>
      <p>One person creates a repo for a new project. All the developers on the project have commit access, they will pull the changes from the repository, modify their own changes, and commit locally. When everything is working fine this commit can later be pushed back in the public repository.</p>
